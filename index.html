        A continuous drive to go the extra mile. Sprouts Farmers Market works to deliver the best possible shopping experience,
        helping customers live a healthy lifestyle at an affordable price, not just buy groceries. Sprouts is a healthy grocery store
        offering fresh, natural and organic foods at great prices. Since 2002, we've been committed to providing our customers with
        the best-in-class service and to improving it every day. </p>

<p>This commitment has taken us from a small grocery store in Chandler, Ariz. to the leading food retailer we are today. We're proud to
serve customers in 10 states with more than 190 stores. Additionally, we strive to be the ultimate healthy living resource with recipes,
how-to videos, wellness webinars and compelling content on sprouts.com. Our social media sites and email subscriptions give customers
exclusive access to health tips, product information, and web-only coupons for extra savings. Our money-back guarantee, online experiences
and product promotions allow us to serve more customers in fresh, new ways.</p>

<p>We believe food is an industry of innovation, and in that spirit we are flexible, adaptable and responsive. Foods change. Tastes change.
Times change. But our commitment to happy, healthy customers will never change.Take a look at what we have to offer and fill out the comment form on the prices page.
