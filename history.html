    <h2> Our History</h2>
        <p><span class="About">Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.</span> was founded by members of the Boney family, long-time San Diego
        grocers with a focus on making fresh foods affordable. The company opened its first store in Chandler, Ariz. in 2002 with abundant
        produce and thousands of natural, organic and great-tasting foods at remarkably low prices.</p>

<p>The Sprouts story continued with a period of rapid growth through acquisitions and new store development. In 2011, Sprouts joined
with Henry's Holdings, which ran 35 Henry's Farmers Markets stores and eight Sun Harvest Market stores. A year later, the company bought
Sunflower Farmers Market, which ran 37 stores.</p>

<p>In 2012, Sprouts was named the No. 1 Hot Retailer by Stores magazine. It then became a public company traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market
in August 2013. Today, Sprouts operates more than 165 stores in eight states and has become one of the largest specialty retailers of natural and
organic food in the United States.</p>

<p>This commitment has taken us from a small grocery store in Chandler, Ariz. to the leading food retailer we are today. We're proud to
serve customers in 10 states with more than 190 stores. Additionally, we strive to be the ultimate healthy living resource with recipes,
how-to videos, wellness webinars and compelling content on sprouts.com. Our social media sites and email subscriptions give customers
exclusive access to health tips, product information, and web-only coupons for extra savings. Our money-back guarantee, online experiences
and product promotions allow us to serve more customers in fresh, new ways.</p>

<p>We believe food is an industry of innovation, and in that spirit we are flexible, adaptable and responsive. Foods change. Tastes change.
Times change. But our commitment to happy, healthy customers will never change.</p>
